Courage:

Several practices embody courage. During development of our project, we will always tell the truth about progress and estimates of the project. We already have planned to succeed so we will not document any excuses for failure. We are in a team so we do not have any fear in our mind. We are ready to adopt changes as per the requirement of the project. We will put an effort to avoid getting bogged down in design and requiring a lot of effort to implement anything else. Courage will enable us to feel comfortable with a refactoring of our code whenever it is necessary. We have the courage to review the existing system and modify it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. We will show courage in knowing that when to throw code away like courage to remove source code that is obsolete. If we are stuck in any complex problems then we have the courage to overcome the problem by remaining patient. It may happen that we have not worked on certain technologies before but we have the courage to learn them and implement in our project as per needed.

In week 1, We need to show courage in deciding the idea of our project so that we can develop and implement our idea in coming weeks.
We also have to show courage in deciding the technology and game engine which will involve in our project so that we can work on it to improve the idea in better way. As we have other subject projects as well so we need to have courage in deciding timing we need to give to project and to be on progress track.

Week:2

In week 2, We came up with the idea of project which required courage to explore all other ideas and come to conclusion. We came up with the technolgy and game engine which required courage to search on other technolgies and game engines. We showed courage in finding technolgy which can give us optimum solution to our idea. We need courage to update the project progress on github with cumulative flow diagram and burndown chart.

Week:3

In week 3, We need to show courage in learning new game engine. We already have decided to structure 3 stages in our game so for this we need to have courage to learn many things and implement it. So after learning the basic things in our game engine i.e Greenfoot we came up with the basic prototype of our game link of which is given in README.md.

In week 4, We need to show courage to explore other things like methodologies and design patterns which we will be using in our peoject. Along with all this things we need to show courage in making rough sketch of our game levels so that we can get the exact idea of what we will be building. We need to show courage in study of design patterns. Everyone in team is studying design patterns which we need to implement in our project. Courage is the main factor which will play the important role in upcoming weeks
