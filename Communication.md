Week #1

Software is developed as quickly as possible when there is some sort of communication in projects. Everyone is part of the team and should communicate face to face. As a team, we had face to face communication couple of times this week. We created our group on Whatsapp, a messaging service and had interactions with each other on Whatsapp regarding the different game topics. We met and discussed the game topics and received everyone's feedback on all the topics. We discussed on which technologies we are going to base our project on and hence we decided Alladin game as our best choice. We will work together on everything from requirements to code.


Week #2 
* As the project idea is decided, it's time to find out the resources and technologies that will be required to  complete the project.

Week #3
* We developed a prototype for our game, while doing so we faced some issues like how to make the background dynamic, hence we assigned different tasks to every member in the group.
